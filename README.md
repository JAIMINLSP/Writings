# Writings
Contained here are writings of my own Work split into several main sections:
- Empire (Matters concerning the Betterment of Humanity's Future and its Society)
- My Life (Matters concerning the Reflections upon my Life)
- Poetry (Any compositions that I wish to make)
- Miscellany

It will be worth noting that My Writings are Originally Written upon Paper with Pen, and so many entries within "My Life" will not be contained on this repository due to very personal content. Although this will be reconsidered later on in my life should I need to have them contained on this server.
