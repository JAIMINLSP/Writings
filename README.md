# Writings

These Writings serve as an output for my thoughts. I like to think they are constructive and well thought out, but they may lack insight at the time of their writing. Therefore, I ask for those who read this to take these things into account:
- The last thing I want to do is cause offence, be judgmental, or be arrogant. So, if you see elements of these things in my writings, please know that I do not wish for such elements to be there, and that they exist in error.
- My thoughts can sometimes seem like those out of a fantasy, especially if I talk about a topic such as politics, the future, or religion. What I ask is simply forgiveness if I seem to be lacking in proper knowledge within these topics, but I would also like you to know that I try my best to be knowledgeable.
- More than anything I wish for my writings to give some sort of foundation for more thought and more discussion in whatever area or field I touch on, so I hope that this collection of mine holds value and is enjoyable to read.

Contained here are writings, of my own work, split into several main sections:
- Philosophy and Religion (matters concerning either Philosophy or Religion or both)
- World (matters concerning the betterment of humanity's future and its society)
- Poetry (any compositions that I have made)
- Miscellany

It will be worth noting that there is a section that exists called "My Life" whereby I reflect upon my life, however this section will not be uploaded here and only exists in hardcopy.

Files and folders within any of the main sections will have a naming convention of:
- [date]-[title]
- For example: 2020-06-25_This-is-a-sample-file.txt

Where [date] is the date of creation of the entry in the format YYYY-MM-DD. [title] is the title of the entry.
