# Writings
Contained here are writings of my own Work split into several main sections:
- Philosophy and Religion (Matters concerning either Philosophy or Religion or both)
- Empire (Matters concerning the Betterment of Humanity's Future and its Society)
- Poetry (Any compositions that I have made)
- Miscellany

It will be worth noting that there is a section that exists called "My Life" whereby I reflect upon my life, however this section will not be uploaded here and only exists in hardcopy. All of my Writings are written on paper initially, and so "My Life" will stay as such due to its very personal nature.

Files and Folders within any of the main sections will have a naming convention of:
- [num]-[date]-[title]

Where [date] is the date of creation of the entry in Roman Numerals. [num] is to express the order of each entry and make sure all are displayed in chronological order since the Roman Numeral Dates won't be automatically sorted in numeric/chronological order. [title] is the title of the entry.
