# Writings
Contained here are writings of my own Work split into several main sections:
- Philosophy and Religion (Matters concerning either Philosophy or Religion or both)
- Empire (Matters concerning the Betterment of Humanity's Future and its Society)
- My Life (Matters concerning My Reflections upon my Life)
- Poetry (Any compositions that I have made)
- Miscellany

It will be worth noting that My Writings are Originally Written upon Paper with Pen, and so many entries within "My Life" will not be contained on this repository due to very personal content. Although this will be reconsidered later on in my life should I need to have them contained on this server.

Files and Folders within any of the main sections will have a naming convention of:
- [num]-[date]-[title]
Where [date] is the date of creation of the entry. [num] is to express order of each entry and make sure all are displayed in chronological order since the Roman Numeral Date won't be automatically sorted in numeric/chronological order. [title] is the title of the entry.
